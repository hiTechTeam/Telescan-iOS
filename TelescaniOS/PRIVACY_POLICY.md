# Privacy Policy for Telescan

**Effective Date:** December 25, 2025

## Introduction

Telescan ("we," "us," or "our") is committed to protecting your privacy. This Privacy Policy explains how we collect, use, disclose, and safeguard your information when you use our iOS application ("App") that enables proximity-based discovery of nearby users through their Telegram profiles.

By using Telescan, you agree to the collection and use of information in accordance with this policy. We do not collect or store any personal location data.

## Information We Collect

### Information You Provide

- **Telegram Profile Data**: When you authenticate using the Telegram-generated code, we collect your Telegram ID, display name, username, and profile photo URL from Telegram's API.
- **Authentication Codes**: Temporary codes generated by our Telegram bot are SHA256 hashed before transmission and are not stored in plaintext.

### Information Collected Automatically

- **Device Information**: We collect basic device information necessary for BLE functionality, such as device identifiers used for proximity discovery.
- **BLE Signal Data**: We temporarily process Bluetooth Low Energy signal strength (RSSI) to estimate approximate distance to nearby devices. This data is processed locally and not stored or transmitted.

### Information We Do Not Collect

- **Location Data**: We do not collect, store, or track your precise location, GPS coordinates, or movement patterns.
- **Contact Lists**: We do not access or store your phone contacts.
- **Usage Analytics**: We do not collect analytics, crash reports, or usage statistics.
- **Advertising Data**: We do not use advertising identifiers or track for advertising purposes.

## How We Use Information

We use the collected information solely for the following purposes:

- **Profile Discovery**: To display your profile to nearby users who have Telescan installed and are scanning.
- **Authentication**: To verify your identity through the Telegram integration.
- **App Functionality**: To enable BLE-based proximity detection and profile sharing.
- **Service Improvement**: To maintain and improve the technical functionality of the app.

## Information Sharing and Disclosure

We do not sell, trade, or otherwise transfer your personal information to third parties, except in the following limited circumstances:

- **With Your Consent**: When you choose to share your profile by enabling scanning.
- **Service Providers**: We may use third-party services (such as cloud storage for profile images) that are contractually obligated to maintain privacy.
- **Legal Requirements**: If required by law or to protect our rights, we may disclose information in response to legal processes.

### Telegram Integration

Your profile data is fetched directly from Telegram's API using your authentication. We do not store Telegram messages, contacts, or other private Telegram data.

## Data Security

We implement appropriate technical and organizational measures to protect your information:

- **Encryption**: All network communications use HTTPS/TLS encryption.
- **Hashing**: Authentication codes are SHA256 hashed before any transmission.
- **Local Processing**: BLE data and distance calculations are processed locally on your device.
- **Minimal Storage**: Profile data is cached temporarily and cleared when devices go out of range.
- **No Persistent Identifiers**: We do not use permanent device identifiers or tracking cookies.

## Data Retention

- **Profile Data**: Stored on our servers only as long as your Telegram account remains active and you use the service.
- **Cached Data**: Profile information is cached locally on your device for brief periods (typically minutes) and automatically cleared.
- **Authentication Data**: Hashed codes are not retained after successful authentication.

## Your Rights and Choices

You have the following rights regarding your data:

- **Control Discovery**: You can enable or disable BLE scanning at any time.
- **Profile Management**: You can update your profile photo through the app.
- **Data Deletion**: Contact us to request deletion of your profile data from our servers.
- **Withdraw Consent**: You can stop using the app and delete it from your device.
